# Code and data for the article titled "Branched flows of flexural elastic waves in non-uniform cylindrical shells"

`waveSimCode_HPC.zip` contains the codes to setup and run the FEM (ANSYS) wave elastodynamics simulations. The code is configured to run on the University of Southampton's HPC (IRIDIS 5).

`waveSimData.zip` contains the raw values of $l_f$ obtained from FEM wave elastodynamics simulations.

`raySimCode.zip` contains the codes to setup and run the ray simulations.

`waveSimData.zip` contains the raw values of $l_f$ obtained from ray simulations.

`field.zip` contains the data corresponding to the exemplar random spatially-correlated field $h(x,y)$ shown in the paper.
